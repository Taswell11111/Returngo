# ReturnGO API Documentation (reference placeholder)

I attempted to fetch the official ReturnGO API documentation automatically but could not retrieve the remote pages in this environment. Placeholders and known doc URLs are listed below — download the full docs and paste into this file for an offline reference.

Official documentation URLs to try:
- https://docs.returngo.ai
- https://returngo.ai/docs
- https://api.returngo.ai/docs

How to update this file with full docs:
1. Open one of the URLs above in a browser.
2. Save the documentation HTML or copy the relevant sections.
3. Paste the content below this header and commit to your repo.

Notes:
- The app uses `GET https://api.returngo.ai/rmas` with headers `x-shop-name` and `x-api-key`. Confirm exact query parameters and RMA detail endpoints in the official docs.
- If you want, I can re-run a fetch attempt once network access is available or when you provide a reachable docs URL.
